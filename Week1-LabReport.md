## Part-1 Setting up VS Code

If you do not wish to download VS Code on your personal computer, you can skip this part and just open VS Code on one of the computers in the lab.

Go to the Visual Studio Code Website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the provided instructions to install VS Code on ypour operating system.
I personally did not do this as I already had Visual Studio Code installed.

Once installed, and set up you should arrive at a window that looks like this:

**You're now all set to use Visual Studio Code**
