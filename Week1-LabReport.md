# Setting up VS Code and Connecting to your Specific Remote Computer
***
## Part-1 Setting up VS Code

If you do not wish to download VS Code on your personal computer, you can skip this part and just open VS Code on one of the computers in the lab.

Go to the Visual Studio Code Website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the provided instructions to install VS Code on ypour operating system.

I personally did not do this as I already had Visual Studio Code installed.

Once installed and set up, you should arrive at a window that looks like this:

**You're now all set to use Visual Studio Code**

## Part-2 Remotely Connecting to the Server

Many course in CSE use course-specific accounts. These are similar to corporate or company accounts one might receive for future opportunities. Here we'll see how to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do work there.

Step 1) This is a first step if you're on Windows: install `git` for windows using the provided link

 [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
 
Step 2) Setting `git bash` as the default terminal
 
 - Open VS Code and press and hold `Ctrl` + `'` to open the terminal.
 - Open the Command Palette using `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`
 - search for the - Select Default Profile option
 - Select Git Bash
 - Now click on the + icon in the Terminal
 - The new Terminal will now be a Git Bash terminal

 Step 3) Now, we will start actually connecting to the remote computer.
