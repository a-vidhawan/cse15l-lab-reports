First, I got the command terminal open on my computer, and a browser as well. Then I executed the following steps.

**Step 1)** I deleted any existing forks of the [lab 7](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) repository I already had on my account.

**Step 2)** I forked the [lab 7 repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) with my account. And copied the `ssh` clone link.

**Step 3)** The timer now **starts**!

**Step 4)** I typed in the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23___@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where the blank space is for every student's unique three letter account number. Then i pressed <Enter>.

The command `ssh` is used to log into a remote server.

**Step 5)** I typed in the command `$ git clone git@github.com:ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7.git` and pressed <Enter>.

The `git clone` command downloads all the files from the repositry into the current directory.

**Step 6)** Now I executed the command `cd lab7` to change the working directory to lab7, and then executed `ls` to see what was in the repository.

The `cd` command changes thge working directory, and `ls` lists all files and sub directories.

**Step 7)** I pressed `Ctrl + R` and typed in 'javac' to look for the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command in my history and pressed <Enter>.
            Then pressed `Ctrl + R` and typed 'java -' to look for the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command in my history and pressed <Enter>.

The `Ctrl + R` shortcut is used to search through your history, the `javac` command is to compile all files in the working directory, and the `java` command is to rubn the test class.

**Step 8)** I typed in `nano ` and pressed <Tab> to autocomplete it
